<h1>Project Statement</h1> <h2>Problem Statement</h2> <p>In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to manage their daily tasks effectively due to the lack of simple, accessible tools for tracking personal to-do lists. Many existing applications are either overly complex, require internet connectivity, or lack persistence across devices. Users need a lightweight, offline-capable solution that allows them to add, view, update, and delete tasks securely, with data stored locally in a database. Without such a tool, people may forget important tasks, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress. This project addresses the need for a user-friendly, command-line-based to-do list application that ensures task management is straightforward, personalized, and persistent.</p> <h2>Scope of the Project</h2> <p>The project focuses on developing a command-line Python application for personal task management. It includes core functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks (CRUD operations) stored in a MySQL database. The scope encompasses user authentication via username input, secure database connections, and basic error handling. Out-of-scope elements include graphical user interfaces (GUIs), multi-user collaboration, cloud synchronization, advanced analytics, or integration with external APIs. The application is designed to run on local machines with MySQL installed, ensuring portability and simplicity. Future enhancements (e.g., web interfaces) are not part of the current scope.</p> <h2>Target Users</h2> <p>The primary target users are individuals who need a simple tool for organizing personal tasks, such as students managing assignments, professionals tracking work-related items, freelancers handling project deadlines, or anyone seeking to improve daily productivity. Users should have basic familiarity with command-line interfaces and access to a computer with Python and MySQL installed. The app is ideal for tech-savvy users who prefer lightweight, no-frills solutions over feature-heavy apps like Trello or Todoist.</p> <h2>High-Level Features</h2> <ul> <li><strong>User Personalization</strong>: Allows users to enter a name for a personalized to-do list experience.</li> <li><strong>Task Management</strong>: Supports adding new tasks with descriptions, viewing all tasks sorted by status, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks.</li> <li><strong>Database Persistence</strong>: Stores tasks in a MySQL database, with automatic setup of database and tables.</li> <li><strong>Secure Access</strong>: Prompts for MySQL password securely and handles connections reliably.</li> <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Provides feedback for invalid inputs, database errors, and edge cases like non-existent tasks.</li> <li><strong>Command-Line Interface</strong>: Simple menu-driven navigation for all operations.</li> </ul>
